# What is Heaps Platformer

It is a learning project, that I try to build a 2D platformer
which demonstrates how we develop game with [Heaps.io](https://heaps.io).
I set the goal as a list of following.

- [ ] Basic Gameplay
  - [ ] One level game
  - [ ] Tiled-based 2D scene
  - [ ] Character can walk and jump
  - [ ] Enemy collision
  - [ ] Enemy attack
  - [ ] Camera move
  - [ ] Music and sound effects
- [ ] Engineering
  - [ ] Build process
  - [ ] Resource packing
- [ ] Runnable on desktop platforms
  - [ ] Linux
  - [ ] Windows 10 or above
  - [ ] macOS (with code-sign and notarization)
- [ ] Optionally runnable on mobile platforms
  - [ ] iOS
  - [ ] Android
  - [ ] An Linux-based rk3326 device

Though I don't plan a concrete time to finish it, I expect the itemized
list can be finished by end of March 2023, with the optional items be
possible exceptions.
